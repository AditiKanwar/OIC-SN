## SNOiC: Soft Labeling and Noisy Mixup based Open Intent Classification Model

A M+1 Open Intent Classification (OIC) model is proposed that comprises
Soft Labeling and Noisy Mixup methods to classify M known intent classes
correctly, and classes other than that are classified to M+1 class, known as
open intent class

# Environment -
-Python 3.6

# Model 
Get Obtain the pre-trained BERT model and convert it to Pytorch, then specify the path of the uncased-bert model as the "bert_model" parameter in the init_parameter.py file.

# Run Instructions
Run using script files present in script folder.

*default values mentioned in experimental settings are hardcoded, can be changed according to requirement.
